Format Python code (list of lists) as a fixed width table.

## Motivation and usage

You've got some tests or other code like this:
```python

def test_the_table():
    assert generate_the_table() == [
        ['Date', 'Description', 'Amount', 'Balance'],
        ['2021-04-06', 'Account opened', 0, 0],
        ['2021-04-07', 'Cash deposit at 123 Main St, Newtown', 1000, 1000],
        ['2021-04-08', 'ACME anvils', -300, 700],
    ]
```

Or maybe even worse like this:

```python
assert generate_the_table() == [
    [
        "Date",
        "Description",
        "Amount",
        "Balance",
    ],
    [
        "2021-04-06",
        "Account opened",
        0,
        0,
    ],
    [
        "2021-04-07",
        "Cash deposit at 123 Main St, Newtown",
        1000,
        1000,
    ],
    [
        "2021-04-08",
        "ACME anvils",
        -300,
        700,
    ],
]
```

Wouldn't it be nice to have readable tests with columns all lined up?

Copy the whole list of lists to the clipboard, then pipe to ``table-format
--guess-indent``:
* on Linux you can use `xsel` or `xclip`
* on MacOS you can use `pbpaste`
* on Windows Powershell you can use `Get-Clipboard`

Linux example:

```shell
$ xsel | table-format --guess-indent
[
        ['Date',       'Description',                          'Amount', 'Balance'],
        ['2021-04-06', 'Account opened',                       0,        0        ],
        ['2021-04-07', 'Cash deposit at 123 Main St, Newtown', 1000,     1000     ],
        ['2021-04-08', 'ACME anvils',                          -300,     700      ],
    ]
```

The output should be ready to paste back into your editor.

### Options

Pass the `--help` flag to show all options:

```shell
$ table-format --help
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

The most recent release can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/table-format/) with:

```bash
$ pip install table-format
```

You can also use [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to install it more
conveniently in an isolated environment:

```bash
$ pipx install table-format
```
See [CHANGES](CHANGES.md) for changelog.

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/spookylukey/table-format.git
```

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/spookylukey/table-format.git
$ cd table-format
$ pip install -e .
```

## Other tips

### Tuples

We also support having lists of tuples as well as lists of lists, and this will be preserved.

### Black

Black will revert code formatted like this. But you can use `# fmt: off` and `#
fmt: on` commands to stop black reformatting these blocks.

To format quotes more similarly to Black style, use ``--quote-style=double``
(this won‚Äôt be exactly the same as Black, it just switches to double quotes
instead of single).

### Flake8

Flake8 might complain about:

- E202 - whitespace before `]`
- E241 - multiple spaces after comma
- E501 - line too long


The simplest solution is to silence those flake8 errors globally in your config,
especially if you are using a formatter like Black which will enforce those same
rules for you automatically.

Otherwise, you can silence the errors on a per-line basis using
`noqa:E202,E241,E501`, which you can automatically add to the end of each line
like this:

```bash
$ table-format --add-noqa=E202,E241,E501
```

Other ``noqa`` items and other end of line comments will be preserved.

### Emacs
With default keybindings, doing `C-u` `M-|` `table-format --guess-indent` `ENTER` will
replace the current region with the formatted version from `table-format`.

You can wrap it up in a nice function like this:

```elisp
(defun align-python-table ()
  (interactive)
  (shell-command-on-region
   ;; beginning and end of region
   (region-beginning)
   (region-end)
   ;; command and parameters
   "table-format --guess-indent"
   ;; output buffer
   (current-buffer)
   ;; replace?
   t
   ;; name of the error buffer
   "*Table-Format Error Buffer*"
   ;; show error buffer?
   t))
```
